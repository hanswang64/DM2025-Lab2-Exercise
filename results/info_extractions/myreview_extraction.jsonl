They taught me that some emotion is so powerful \nthat it can’t be put into mere words—it must be sung. Some love is so \noverwhelming that you just have to move your feet. With a family that loved \nclassic films, I remember being awed by Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, thinking \nthey were as cool as anyone in movie history. Characters in musicals not only \nunderstood love differently than those in traditional films but they turned that \nunderstanding into art—dancing, singing and transcending mere dialogue to \nbecome something greater, something purer, something closer to true romance. \nWe’ve had some musicals since the era of Rogers & Astaire, but few that have \ntried to recapture that sense of fluid, magical thinking in which characters \ncommunicate with their bodies as much, maybe even more, than they do with \ntheir voices. One of many remarkable things about Damien Chazelle’s “La La \nLand” is how much energy and time it devotes to movement and music, not just \nlyrics. The modern movie musicals, so often based on Broadway shows, have \nfocused heavily on songs that further plot. In Chazelle’s vision, choreography \nmatters and a simple piano refrain can have more power than a lyric. This is a \nbeautiful film about love and dreams, and how the two impact each other. Los \nAngeles is filled with dreamers, and sometimes it takes a partner to make your \ndream come true. \n“La La Land” opens with a bit of a fake-out in that it’s a large ensemble number \nof a variety that we won’t really see again in the movie. Cars are stuck in the \nnotoriously awful L.A. traffic when the drivers decide to break into song called \n“Another Day of Sun”—a bit about how each day brings new hope for these \nyoung wannabe artists—jumping out of the cars and dancing on the freeway. \nInstantly, Chazelle’s direction and the dance choreography feels different. Here, \nand throughout the film, he works in long, unbroken takes. You can not only see \nthe dance moves, but you can see the dancer’s entire body when he or she \nperforms them. And after the chorus-like introduction to a city of dreamers, we \nmeet two such sun-gazers: pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia \n(Emma Stone). Like any good musical, the two have a few false starts and \nplayfully mock each other’s flaws in their first scenes. But we know where this is \nheaded and Gosling & Stone have the chemistry to make us long for them to get\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\ntogether. \nThe first major centerpiece scene is a long walk between Sebastian and Mia as \nthe sun is setting over the Hollywood Hills. They start to see similarities in one \nanother. Mia is tired of going on worthless auditions, ones in which the producer \ndoesn’t even look up from their phone. Sebastian holds on to an ideal version of \njazz, wanting to open his own club instead of selling out and playing greatest hits \nfor tourists. And Sebastian and Mia have a clear, instant attraction. So, even as \nthey sing about how they’re not really a couple, and how this gorgeous night is \nwasted because they’re not with their true partners, their bodies tell another \nstory with a fantastically choreographed dance number. Stone and Gosling aren’t \nnatural singers or dancers, but they bring so much character and commitment to \nevery movement that it doesn’t matter. They’re fluid, engaged and mesmerizing. \nWe watch them fall in love through dance. \nOf course, it helps that Gosling and Stone have the kind of star power that made \nso many of those classic era musicals memorable. He’s smooth and \ncharismatic; she’s clever and beautiful. The phrase has lost most of its meaning, \nbut these are movie stars. And, of course, they’re more than capable when “La \nLa Land” demands greater depth, finding characters so rich that the movie would \nwork without the music. It’s a story of artistic passion, and how easy it is to get \nderailed from your dream. Sometimes it takes another person to push you back \non to the tracks to find it again. Gosling and Stone get these characters, finding \ngrace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs; Stone has never been \nbetter. \n“La La Land” also exists as a very conscious ode to the allure of classic \nHollywood. The pair goes to see “Rebel Without a Cause” (ending in one of the \nmost magical scenes in years) and films like “Casablanca” and “Bringing Up \nBaby” are name-dropped. We have seen dozens of films that try to capture the \nallure of Hollywood, often with the cynical viewpoint that it will chew you up and \nspit you out, but Chazelle’s vision feels unique. It pays homage to musicals like \n“Singin’ in the Rain” and Jacques Demy’s “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” without \nevery directly mimicking them.   \nIt’s easy to let the world get you down sometimes, especially in a year like this\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\none. It’s easy to think that dreams don’t come true, and that love only exists in \nmovies. “La La Land” serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and \nthey can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us. It’s \nnot so much another day in the sun, as the characters sing in that opening \nnumber, but the dreams of the night before, the ones we wake up and try to fulfill, \nthat keep us dancing. \nThis review was originally published on September 14, 2016 as a part of our TIFF \ncoverage.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_eaa539b8"}
