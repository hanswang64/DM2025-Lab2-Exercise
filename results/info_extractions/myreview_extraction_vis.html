<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Musicals made me a romantic</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">They taught me that some emotion is so powerful 
that it can’t be put into mere words—it must be sung</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Some love is so 
overwhelming that you just have to move your feet</span>. With a family that loved 
classic films, I remember being awed by Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">thinking 
they were as cool as anyone in movie history</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Characters in musicals not only 
understood love differently than those in traditional films but they turned that 
understanding into art—dancing, singing and transcending mere dialogue to 
become something greater, something purer, something closer to true romance</span>. 
We’ve had some musicals since the era of Rogers &amp; Astaire, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">few that have 
tried to recapture that sense of fluid, magical thinking in which characters 
communicate with their bodies as much, maybe even more, than they do with 
their voices</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">One of many remarkable things about Damien Chazelle’s “La La 
Land” is how much energy and time it devotes to movement and music, not just 
lyrics</span>. The modern movie musicals, so often based on Broadway shows, have 
focused heavily on songs that further plot. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">In Chazelle’s vision, choreography 
matters and a simple piano refrain can have more power than a lyric</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This is a 
beautiful film about love and dreams, and how the two impact each other</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Los 
Angeles is filled with dreamers, and sometimes it takes a partner to make your 
dream come true</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">“La La Land” opens with a bit of a fake-out in that it’s a large ensemble number 
of a variety that we won’t really see again in the movie</span>. Cars are stuck in the 
notoriously awful L.A. traffic when the drivers decide to break into song called 
“Another Day of Sun”—<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a bit about how each day brings new hope for these 
young wannabe artists</span>—jumping out of the cars and dancing on the freeway. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Instantly, Chazelle’s direction and the dance choreography feels different</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Here, 
and throughout the film, he works in long, unbroken takes</span>. You can not only see 
the dance moves, but you can see the dancer’s entire body when he or she 
performs them. And after the chorus-like introduction to a city of dreamers, we 
meet two such sun-gazers: pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia 
(Emma Stone). Like any good musical, the two have a few false starts and 
playfully mock each other’s flaws in their first scenes. But we know where this is 
headed and Gosling &amp; Stone <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">have the chemistry to make us long for them to get</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
together. 
The first major centerpiece scene is a long walk between Sebastian and Mia as 
the sun is setting over the Hollywood Hills. They start to see similarities in one 
another. Mia is tired of going on worthless auditions, ones in which the producer 
doesn’t even look up from their phone. Sebastian holds on to an ideal version of 
jazz, wanting to open his own club instead of selling out and playing greatest hits 
for tourists. And Sebastian and Mia have a clear, instant attraction. So, even as 
they sing about how they’re not really a couple, and how this gorgeous night is 
wasted because they’re not with their true partners, their bodies tell another 
story with a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">fantastically choreographed dance number</span>. Stone and Gosling aren’t 
natural singers or dancers, but they <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">bring so much character and commitment to 
every movement that it doesn’t matter</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">They’re fluid, engaged and mesmerizing</span>. 
We watch them fall in love through dance. 
Of course, it helps that Gosling and Stone have the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">kind of star power that made 
so many of those classic era musicals memorable</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He’s smooth and 
charismatic; she’s clever and beautiful</span>. The phrase has lost most of its meaning, 
but these are movie stars. And, of course, they’re <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">more than capable when “La 
La Land” demands greater depth</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">finding characters so rich that the movie would 
work without the music</span>. It’s a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">story of artistic passion</span>, and how easy it is to get 
derailed from your dream. Sometimes it takes another person to push you back 
on to the tracks to find it again. Gosling and Stone get these characters, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">finding 
grace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs</span>; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stone has never been 
better</span>. 
“La La Land” also exists as a very conscious ode to the allure of classic 
Hollywood. The pair goes to see “Rebel Without a Cause” (ending in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one of the 
most magical scenes in years</span>) and films like “Casablanca” and “Bringing Up 
Baby” are name-dropped. We have seen dozens of films that try to capture the 
allure of Hollywood, often with the cynical viewpoint that it will chew you up and 
spit you out, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Chazelle’s vision feels unique</span>. It <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">pays homage to musicals</span> like 
“Singin’ in the Rain” and Jacques Demy’s “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">without 
every directly mimicking them</span>.   
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">It’s easy to let the world get you down sometimes</span>, especially in a year like this
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
one. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">It’s easy to think that dreams don’t come true</span>, and that love only exists in 
movies. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">“La La Land” serves to remind us that movies can still be magical</span>, and 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">they can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us</span>. It’s 
not so much another day in the sun, as the characters sing in that opening 
number, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the dreams of the night before, the ones we wake up and try to fulfill, 
that keep us dancing</span>.
