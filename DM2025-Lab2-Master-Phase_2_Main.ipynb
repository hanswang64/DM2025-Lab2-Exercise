       "*   **Interpretability vs. Accuracy:** Complex models (like deep neural networks) often achieve high accuracy but are difficult to understand, making it hard to explain the insights derived. Simpler models might be more interpretable but less accurate.\n",
       "*   **Overfitting and Underfitting:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns.\n",
       "*   **Computational Complexity:** Some algorithms have high computational requirements, making them impractical for real-time analysis or on resource-constrained systems.\n",

       "\n",
       "Here are the key challenges in data mining:\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Data-Related Challenges (The Foundation)\n",
       "\n",
       "This is often the most time-consuming part of any data mining project. If the foundational data is poor, the results will be unreliable.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Data Quality and Cleaning:** Raw data is almost always \"dirty.\"\n",
       "    *   **Incomplete Data:** Missing values in records can skew results or make analysis impossible.\n",
       "    *   **Noisy Data:** The data contains errors, outliers, or incorrect entries (e.g., a person's age listed as 200).\n",
       "    *   **Inconsistent Data:** Contradictions or different formatting for the same entity (e.g., \"New York,\" \"NY,\" and \"N.Y.C.\" in the same database).\n",
       "    *   **The \"80/20 Rule\":** It's commonly said that data scientists spend about 80% of their time just cleaning and preparing data, and only 20% on actual analysis and modeling.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Big Data (Volume, Velocity, and Variety):**\n",
       "    *   **Volume:** The sheer amount of data can be overwhelming. Standard algorithms and single machines cannot handle terabytes or petabytes of data efficiently. This requires distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark.\n",
       "    *   **Velocity:** Data is often generated in real-time streams (e.g., social media feeds, IoT sensor data). The challenge is to process and analyze this data on the fly before it becomes outdated.\n",
       "    *   **Variety:** Data comes in many forms—structured (like SQL tables), semi-structured (like JSON or XML), and unstructured (like text, images, audio, and video). Mining unstructured data requires specialized techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Data Integration:** Data often resides in different, isolated sources (silos). Combining data from various databases, APIs, and files is a major challenge due to differences in schemas, data types, and entity identification.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Methodological and Algorithmic Challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "These challenges relate to the techniques and models used to extract insights.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Algorithm Selection:** There is no \"one-size-fits-all\" algorithm. Choosing the right one depends on the business problem, the type of data, and the desired outcome. For example, a decision tree might be chosen for its interpretability, while a deep neural network might be chosen for its high accuracy on complex patterns.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Interpretability (The \"Black Box\" Problem):** Many powerful models, especially deep learning models, are \"black boxes.\" They can make incredibly accurate predictions, but it's difficult to understand *why* they made a specific decision. This is a huge problem in regulated fields like finance (loan applications) and healthcare (medical diagnoses), where explanations are legally required and crucial for trust.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Model Evaluation and Overfitting:**\n",
       "    *   **Overfitting:** A common pitfall where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and random fluctuations. As a result, it performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
       "    *   **Choosing the Right Metrics:** Simple accuracy can be misleading, especially with imbalanced datasets (e.g., fraud detection, where 99.9% of transactions are not fraudulent). Metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score are often more appropriate.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Scalability and Efficiency:** The chosen algorithms must be able to run on massive datasets within a reasonable timeframe. An algorithm that is theoretically perfect but takes years to run is practically useless.\n",

       "\n",
       "These challenges bridge the gap between a technical model and real-world value.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Defining the Business Problem:** The most critical step is correctly translating a business need into a specific data mining question. A technically brilliant model that solves the wrong problem is a waste of resources.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Integration and Deployment (MLOps):** A model is only useful if it's integrated into a production system where it can influence decisions. This involves building APIs, monitoring performance, and ensuring the system is robust and reliable. This field is often called MLOps (Machine Learning Operations).\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Model Drift and Maintenance:** The world is not static. The patterns in data change over time (e.g., customer behavior shifting after a pandemic). A model trained on old data will gradually lose its accuracy, a phenomenon known as **model drift**. This requires continuous monitoring and periodic retraining of models.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Cost and Resource Management:** Data mining requires significant investment in computing infrastructure (like cloud services), software, and, most importantly, skilled personnel (data scientists, data engineers, domain experts).\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. Ethical and Societal Challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "This is an increasingly important area as data mining becomes more pervasive.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Privacy:** Data mining often involves sensitive personal information. It's crucial to handle this data responsibly and in compliance with regulations like **GDPR** (in Europe) and **CCPA** (in California). Techniques like data anonymization and differential privacy are used to mitigate these risks.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Bias and Fairness:** If the historical data used to train a model contains human biases, the model will learn and often amplify those biases. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n",
       "    *   **Example:** An AI recruiting tool trained on historical hiring data from a company that predominantly hired men might learn to penalize resumes from female candidates.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Security:** Data repositories are valuable targets for cyberattacks. Furthermore, machine learning models themselves can be attacked through adversarial examples—subtly modified inputs designed to trick the model into making a wrong prediction.\n",

      "\n",
      "\t\t Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML algorithms use statistical techniques to enable systems to 'learn' from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without human intervention. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Types of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Common types include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties). \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Applications \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t ML is used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. \n",

      "\t\t A data center is a dedicated physical facility that an organization uses to house its critical IT infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and related components. These facilities are designed to provide a secure, reliable, and controlled environment for computing operations. \n",

      "\t Key Components \n",

      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nMusicals made me a romantic. They taught me that some emotion is so powerful \\nthat it can’t be put into mere words—it must be sung. Some love is so \\noverwhelming that you just have to move your feet. With a family that loved \\nclassic films, I remember being awed by Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, thinking \\nthey were as cool as anyone in movie history. Characters in musicals not only \\nunderstood love differently than those in traditional films but they turned that \\nunderstanding into art—dancing, singing and transcending mere dialogue to \\nbecome something greater, something purer, something closer to true romance. \\nWe’ve had some musicals since the era of Rogers & Astaire, but few that have \\ntried to recapture that sense of fluid, magical thinking in which characters \\ncommunicate with their bodies as much, maybe even more, than they do with \\ntheir voices. One of many remarkable things about Damien Chazelle’s “La La \\nLand” is how much energy and time it devotes to movement and music, not just \\nlyrics. The modern movie musicals, so often based on Broadway shows, have \\nfocused heavily on songs that further plot. In Chazelle’s vision, choreography \\nmatters and a simple piano refrain can have more power than a lyric. This is a \\nbeautiful film about love and dreams, and how the two impact each other. Los \\nAngeles is filled with dreamers, and sometimes it takes a partner to make your \\ndream come true. \\n“La La Land” opens with a bit of a fake-out in that it’s a large ensemble number \\nof a variety that we won’t really see again in the movie. Cars are stuck in the \\nnotoriously awful L.A. traffic when the drivers decide to break into song called \\n“Another Day of Sun”—a bit about how each day brings new hope for these \\nyoung wannabe artists—jumping out of the cars and dancing on the freeway. \\nInstantly, Chazelle’s direction and the dance choreography feels different. Here, \\nand throughout the film, he works in long, unbroken takes. You can not only see \\nthe dance moves, but you can see the dancer’s entire body when he or she \\nperforms them. And after the chorus-like introduction to a city of dreamers, we \\nmeet two such sun-gazers: pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia \\n(Emma Stone). Like any good musical, the two have a few false starts and \\nplayfully mock each other’s flaws in their first scenes. But we know where this is \\nheaded and Gosling & Stone have the chemistry to make us long for them to get\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\ntogether. \\nThe first major centerpiece scene is a long walk between Sebastian and Mia as \\nthe sun is setting over the Hollywood Hills. They start to see similarities in one \\nanother. Mia is tired of going on worthless auditions, ones in which the producer \\ndoesn’t even look up from their phone. Sebastian holds on to an ideal version of \\njazz, wanting to open his own club instead of selling out and playing greatest hits \\nfor tourists. And Sebastian and Mia have a clear, instant attraction. So, even as \\nthey sing about how they’re not really a couple, and how this gorgeous night is \\nwasted because they’re not with their true partners, their bodies tell another \\nstory with a fantastically choreographed dance number. Stone and Gosling aren’t \\nnatural singers or dancers, but they bring so much character and commitment to \\nevery movement that it doesn’t matter. They’re fluid, engaged and mesmerizing. \\nWe watch them fall in love through dance. \\nOf course, it helps that Gosling and Stone have the kind of star power that made \\nso many of those classic era musicals memorable. He’s smooth and \\ncharismatic; she’s clever and beautiful. The phrase has lost most of its meaning, \\nbut these are movie stars. And, of course, they’re more than capable when “La \\nLa Land” demands greater depth, finding characters so rich that the movie would \\nwork without the music. It’s a story of artistic passion, and how easy it is to get \\nderailed from your dream. Sometimes it takes another person to push you back \\non to the tracks to find it again. Gosling and Stone get these characters, finding \\ngrace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs; Stone has never been \\nbetter. \\n“La La Land” also exists as a very conscious ode to the allure of classic \\nHollywood. The pair goes to see “Rebel Without a Cause” (ending in one of the \\nmost magical scenes in years) and films like “Casablanca” and “Bringing Up \\nBaby” are name-dropped. We have seen dozens of films that try to capture the \\nallure of Hollywood, often with the cynical viewpoint that it will chew you up and \\nspit you out, but Chazelle’s vision feels unique. It pays homage to musicals like \\n“Singin’ in the Rain” and Jacques Demy’s “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” without \\nevery directly mimicking them.   \\nIt’s easy to let the world get you down sometimes, especially in a year like this\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 3**\\n\"\"\"\\none. It’s easy to think that dreams don’t come true, and that love only exists in \\nmovies. “La La Land” serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and \\nthey can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us. It’s \\nnot so much another day in the sun, as the characters sing in that opening \\nnumber, but the dreams of the night before, the ones we wake up and try to fulfill, \\nthat keep us dancing. \\nThis review was originally published on September 14, 2016 as a part of our TIFF \\ncoverage.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

The model’s answer was accurate but simplified, missing this historical nuance.\"\"\"\n"

    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n",

    "The zero-shot matrix shows the strongest bias toward predicting joy, especially for fear, sadness, and even some anger examples.\n",
    "Joy has 17 correct, which dominates the model’s predictions.\n",
    "Fear and sadness are often misclassified as joy.\n",
    "No examples are predicted as “fear,” which reveals a lack of understanding of the fear category without guidance.\n",
    "Overall, the model struggles to separate subtle emotional cues without examples, relying heavily on generic semantic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 1-shot prompting (55% accuracy)\n",
    "Adding one example per emotion makes the model’s predictions more balanced across the four categories.\n",
    "Anger improves noticeably (12 → 12 correct, but fewer misclassifications into joy).\n",
    "Sadness improves substantially (7 → 12 correct).\n",
    "Joy classification stays strong (15 correct).\n",
    "Fear improves slightly (4 → 5 correct), but remains the weakest class.\n",
    "The 1-shot matrix shows that even a single example helps the model understand category boundaries and reduces the earlier “joy bias.”\n",
    "\n",

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
